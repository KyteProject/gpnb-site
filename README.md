# The Greatest Park Never Built
> An open source archive for 3D modeling obsticles and parkour spots.

The greatest park never built is a project by Ukemi that aims to digitise the best and most popular training locations around the globe. We want to create a resource to archive these so there will always be a model available to designers. Many of these spots end up being demolished and lost to time. Hopefully by growing this project we can provide them as a resource for anyone looking to design spaces in the future.
